# Infinite Line Load affect on Half Space
-----------------------------------------------------
This folder contains MATLAB functions to calculate the stress in a two-dimensional
half space due to an infinite line load and lithostatic pressure. The functions include
XZ_Stress, Lithostatic_Stress, Normal_Stress, & Shear_Stress.

Once the stress feild is calculated, they can be plotted and saved as video files with
the functions Plot_Stress_Feild and Create_Video_File.

In addition, relative changes in pore pressure can be calculated with the functions 
Permeability_Ratio_Calculator and Plot_Permeability_Ratio.

Finally, Coulomb failure potential can be calculated and plotted with the functions
Failure_Potential and Plot_Failure_Potential.

------------------------------------------------------
All of the functions have documentation, explaining inputs, outputs, and units of variables.
In the documentation, sources for the equations have been cited for further reference.

This would not have been possible without the help of Dr. Carolina Munoz-Saez, Dr. Seth
Saltiel, and Dr. Noah Randolph-Flagg. The literature referenced to make these functions
are included in the documentation, and are also listed here with web addresses:
